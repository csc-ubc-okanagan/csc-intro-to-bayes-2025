# Exploring alternatives with truth tables

* Outline all possible outcomes

* Alternatives are explored with deductive reasoning

* Conclusions are reached using logic

* Uncertainty is either ignored or a complete block

* See [William Spaniel's Logic 101 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKI1h_nAkaQq5MDWlKXu0jeZmLDt-51on)

<br>

For example: "Broken" always implies "Guilty"

```{r truth-table}
tibble(Broken = c(1, 1, 0, 0),
       Guilty = c(1, 0, 1, 0),
       `not Broken` = 1 - Broken,
       `not Guilty` = 1 - Guilty,
       `Broken or Guilty` = Broken + Guilty,
       `Broken and Guilty` = Broken * Guilty,
       ' ... ' = '...') %>%
  mutate(across(! ' ... ', \(x) if_else(x == 0, 'F', 'T'))) %>%
  kable(format = 'html', align = 'c') %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0:3, bold = T, color = 'black')
```

---

# Exploring alternatives with probability tables

* Outline all possible outcomes

* Alternatives are explored with inductive reasoning

* Conclusions are reached using probability

* Uncertainty is acknowledged and leveraged in the framework

<br>

For example: "Broken" does not always imply "Guilty", and vice-versa

```{r probability-table}
prob_table <- tibble(' ' = c('Broken', 'not Broken', 'Total'),
                     Guilty = c(1/3, 1/3, 2/3),
                     'not Guilty' = c(0.01, 1/3 - 0.01, 1/3),
                     Total = Guilty + `not Guilty`)
prob_kable <- prob_table %>%
  kable(format = 'html', align = 'c', digits = 2) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0:3, bold = T, color = 'black')
prob_kable
```

# What is probability?

* A number in the interval $[0, 1]$

* A measure that quantifies the occurrence of random events

* A measure that allows us to quantify the risk of events

* A measure of our confidence in a parameter, hypothesis, or value

<br>

```{r}
prob_kable
```

---

# Probability fundamentals

Let $B$ and $G$ be two events. Then:

* $0 \le P(B) \le 1$

* the probability of "not $B$" is $P(\neg B) = 1 - P(B)$

* $B$ **or** $G$: $P(B \vee G) = P(B) + P(G) - P(B\wedge G)$

* $B$ **and** $G$: $P(B \wedge G) = P(B) \times P(G | B) = P(G) \times P(B | G)$

<br>

```{r}
prob_kable
```

---

# Frequentist probability: the long-run frequency of events

**Frequentist probability**: the unobserved long-term frequency of some event (e.g., "how often does it rain, on average?")

<br>

* Datasets are random: we cannot get attached to a particular dataset

* "What if we observed a different dataset, instead?"

* "What if this dataset is an outlier dataset?"

* "We cannot know how often the cat will break something"

* "Are these random observations compatible with hypothesis $H_0$ or $H_A$?


--

<br>

For example, if $P(B \wedge G) = 1/3$:

* In the long run, the cat will break something 1/3 of the time

* You don't know if the cat will break something next time you leave

---

# Bayesian probability: the relative certainty of events

**Bayesian probability**: the certainty in the relative occurrence of some event (e.g., "how confident am I that it is raining?")

<br>

* Datasets are fixed after observation because they inform our knowledge

* "How do we make inferences from all the data we accumulate?"

* "What if this dataset is an outlier dataset?"

* "How confident can you be that the cat will break something, next time?"

* "What range of values seems credible, given the data?"

--

<br>

For example, if $P(B \wedge G) = 1/3$:

* You are ~33% sure the cat will break something

* Lock the cat in a safe room if its cost is < 1/3 the expected damage

# Priors: An opinion before data collection

# Priors: We all have opinions, even before data collection

Priors:

* summarize our knowledge before data collection

* are independent of future data

* are distributions, not single values

* communicate our uncertainty before data colletion

* can be used to make predictions before data collection

* can vary between people

---

# Are there priors in Frequentist statistics?

Beyesian statistics (generally) start with analyst-informed priors

<br>

Frequentist statistics:

* Hypothesis testing: $H_0$, $H_a$, and p-values

* Ignore priors because uninterested in estimating $\theta$

* Interested in likelihood of data given $\theta$, which is $P(\text{data} | \theta) = \mathcal L(\theta | \text{data})$

* Not interested in finding the most likely value of $\theta$

* $\mathcal L(\theta | \text{data})$ is a function, not a probability distribution

# Likelihood: The information in the data

# Likelihood: What we learn from data

The likelihood:

* summarizes the information we collected through data, $D$

* is independent of the prior and the analyst

* gives $P(D|\theta = \theta_i)$ for all possible values of $\theta_i$, even unrealistic ones

* does not make statements oN $P(D)$ independently of $\theta$

* is the distribution of $P(D|\theta)$, not $P(\theta|D)$

# Posteriors: Our opinion after data collection

Posteriors:

* summarize our total knowledge after data collection: $P(\theta | D)$

* are independent of future data

* are distributions, not single values

* communicate our updated uncertainty after data collection

* can be used to make predictions about $\theta$ after collecting new evidence

* depend more on one's priors if the data had a small sample size

---

# Calculating posteriros using Bayes' theorem

For a parameter $\theta$ and an observed dataset $D$, we have:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(\theta) ~ P(D|\theta)}{P(D)}$$

where $\theta$ could be $P(Guilty)$ and $D$ could be the number of broken objects.

<br>

* $P(\theta | D)$ is the posterior

* $P(\theta)$ is the prior, which summarizes knowledge before data collection

* $P(D | \theta)$ is the likelihood, which summarizes the data you observed

* $P(D)$ is the probability of observing the dataset, independent of $\theta$

# Assessing degrees of belief with Bayesian Epistemology

Should you leave your cat unsupervised? If you leave, the cat will most likely do something it shouldn't, since $P(G) = 0.67 > 0.5$

<br>

```{r}
prob_kable
```

<br>

Based on $P(G)$ alone: if the cat never breaks things when supervised, you should not leave the cat unsupervised!

---

# Assessing risks and costs with Bayesian Epistemology

* Include the cost of mischief by multiplying it by $P(G)$:

<br>

```{r}
# add cost of broken things
prob_table %>%
  mutate(Guilty = c('10 x 0.33 = CAD 3.33', '0 x 0.33 = CAD 0', '3.33'),
         `not Guilty` = c('1 x 0.01 = CAD 0.01', '0 x 0.32 = CAD 0', '0.01'),
         Total = c('3.34', '0', '3.34')) %>%
  mutate(across(2:4, \(x) paste('CAD', x))) %>%
  kable(format = 'html', align = c('l', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0:3, bold = T, color = 'black')
```

<br>

* Do not leave the cat alone if cost of leaving > supervising it

* How do we convert the cat's loneliness to a dollar amount?

---

# Collecting evidence and updating beliefs

* You decide to leave the cat unsuspervised

* You come home to a broken vase

```{r conditional-prob-greyed}
prob_table %>%
  mutate(Guilty = c('10 x 0.33 = CAD 3.33', '200 x 0.33 = CAD 66.6', '70.00'),
         `not Guilty` = c('1 x 0.01 = CAD 0.01', '0 x 0.32 = CAD 0', '0.01'),
         Total = c('3.34', '66.67', '70.01')) %>%
  mutate(across(2:4, \(x) paste('CAD', x))) %>%
  kable(format = 'html', align = c('l', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0:1, bold = T, color = 'black') %>%
  row_spec(2:3, bold = T, color = 'grey50')
```

<br>

* What is the probabilty that the cat is guilty, given the broken vase?

---

# Should you scold the cat?

Conditionalize on something being broken:

```{r conditional-prob}
tibble(' ' = 'Broken',
       Guilty = '0.33 / 0.34 = 0.97',
       `not Guilty` = '0.01 / 0.34 = 0.03',
       Total = '(0.33 + 0.01) / 0.34 = 1') %>%
  kable(format = 'html', align = c('l', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0:1, bold = T, color = 'black')
```

<br>

* Cat is most likely guilty (0.97 > 0.5)

* You can be quite sure the cat broke the vase

---

# Should you change your future behavior?

* You have gained new evidence

* Update your belief based on new evidence

* Update your *behavior* based on your new beliefs:

* remove breakable objects

* lock the cat in a safe room when you leave

# A practical example: updating your beliefs day by day

---

# Your belief prior to data collection

* You get a new cat

* You don't expect your cat to break things, but it could still be possible

* Prior is $\theta \sim B(2, 5)$:

  * Mean of $\theta$ is $\mathbb E(\theta) = 0.286$

  * Mode of $\theta$ is $M(\theta) = 0.2$

```{r, out.width='80%'}
d <- tibble(theta = seq(0, 1, by = 0.001),
            Prior = dbeta(theta, 2, 5))

plot_prior <- function() {
  ggplot(d) +
    geom_area(aes(theta, Prior), fill = PAL[1], color = PAL[1], lwd = 1,
              alpha = A) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = d$theta[which.max(d$Prior)], lty = 'dashed') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = sum(d$theta * d$Prior) / sum(d$Prior)) +
    labs(x = 'P(Broken)', y = 'Probability density')
}

plot_prior()
```

# Running a test

* You leave the cat free to roam before going to campus for the day

* You come back to find nothing broken, but maybe you missed something?

* Update your prior knowledge by including the new data:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(\theta) ~ P(D|\theta)}{P(D)}$$

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.width=12, fig.height=4}

               Posterior = Prior * Likelihood,

               Posterior = Posterior / mean(Posterior))

    scale_color_manual(values = PAL) +

update_prior(a = 1, b = 3)
```

# A second experiment: Bayesian updating

* You leave the cat free to roam again and find nothing broken

* **Note**: your likelihood is independent of your prior!

* Your old posterior becomes your new prior

* You can update your posterior again:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(\theta) ~ P(D|\theta)}{P(D)}$$

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
update_prior(a = 1, b = 3)
```

---

# An unfortunate third experiment

* You leave the cat free to roam again, but this time it breaks something

* You can update your posterior again:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(\theta) ~ P(D|\theta)}{P(D)}$$

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
update_prior(a = 10, b = 1)
```

---

# Bayesian updating: updating all at once is like updating each time

<br>

$$P(\theta|D_1, D_2, D_3)=\frac{P(\theta|D_1,~D_2) ~ P(D_3|\theta)}{P(D_3)}$$

<br>

$$P(\theta|D_1, D_2, D_3)=\frac{P(\theta | D_1) ~ P(D_2|\theta) ~P(D_3 | \theta)}{P(D_2, D_3)}$$

<br>

$$P(\theta|D_1, D_2, D_3)=\frac{P(\theta) ~ P(D_1 | \theta) ~ P(D_2|\theta) ~P(D_3 | \theta)}{P(D_1, D_2, D_3)}$$

<br>

$$P(\theta|D_1, D_2, D_3)=\frac{P(\theta) ~ \prod_i P(D_i|\theta)}{\prod_i P(D_i)}$$

# Summarizing the posterior: Credible intervals

Credible intervals:

* Are a range of believable (i.e., credible) values at some certainty level

* Account for the system you obtained data from

* Do not risk being irrational, as long as your prior was appropriate

* Depend strongly on the prior if the sample size of the data was small:

  * Useful if we want reasonable predictions despite scarce data
  
  * Problematic if we do not have good priors

```{r, fig.height = 2.5}
d %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(theta, Posterior),
            filter(d,
                   cumsum(Posterior) / sum(Posterior) > 0.05,
                   cumsum(Posterior) / sum(Posterior) < 0.95),
            fill = PAL[3], lwd = 1, alpha = A) +
  geom_line(aes(theta, Posterior), color = PAL[3], lwd = 1) +
  labs(x = 'P(Broken)', y = 'Probability density')

# Confidence Intervals vs Credible Intervals

---

# Clarifying Confidence Intervals

* Confidence is in the data under $H_0$, not in $\theta$

* Give good coverage across all values of $\theta$, even impossible ones

* [Are not a measure of our confidence in a hypothesis](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8)

* May be best renamed to "[Compatability Intervals](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l5381)"

* Are highly susceptible to odd datasets

* Work well as $n \rightarrow \infty$

---

# Contrasting Credible Intervals

* Confidence is in the parameters and hypotheses of interest, given the data

* Give good coverage across reasonable values of $\theta$, not unlikely ones

* Can give poor coverage if data contrasts prior beliefs, especially low $n$

* [Are a measure of our confidence in a hypothesis](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8)

* Are robust to to odd datasets

* Work well with small $n$

* Are suitable for [search theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_search_theory)

* Also see [this Stack Exchange post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2272/whats-the-difference-between-a-confidence-interval-and-a-credible-interval) on Confidence vs Credible Intervals

# Summary

---

# Bayesian statistics mirror how many of us learn

<br>

* Prior: $P(\theta)$, belief before data collection

* Likelihood: $P(D|\theta)$, probability of observing the data, given $\theta$

* Posterior: $P(\theta | D)$, belief after data collection

* Posterior allows us to make inferences on the credible value of $\theta$

* Bayesian inference guarantees realistic (but possibly subjective) results

* Bayesian inference constructs a coherent, probabilistic epistemology
